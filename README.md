Hi! I'm @medohxamali! (or just Medoh). I'm a student going to study game development, but I've been in Computer Science since 2021.
My pronouns are they/them, I am a queer dev. I mostly program in Python but do some web development too. I hope to learn C++/C# and Lua, as well as GDScript for Godot.
Currently I like to make silly Discord bots and some silly CLI games. I try not to get code using AI, personally.
